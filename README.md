## 🏆 Performance Leaderboard

We evaluate eight frontier large language models on Build Arena across three task categories (**Transport**, **Support**, **Lift**) and three difficulty levels (Lv.1 Easy, Lv.2 Medium, Lv.3 Hard) under our baseline agentic workflow. Performance is measured by success rate, with **64 samples per task-model pair** to ensure statistical reliability.

| Rank | Model | Full Model Name | Transport<br>Avg Success Rate | Support<br>Avg Success Rate | Lift<br>Avg Success Rate | Overall Performance |
|:----:|-------|----------------|:-----------------------------:|:---------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 🥇 | **Grok-4** | grok4-0709 | **11.5%** | **20.8%** | **21.9%** | **Excellent** |
| 🥈 | **Claude-4** | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | 12.5% | 3.1% | 4.2% | Good |

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Install uv Package Manager

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) following the official guidance.

### Step 2: Synchronize Virtual Environment

```bash
uv sync
```

### Alternative: Use Conda

Instead of Steps 1 and 2, run the following from the repository root:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate BuildArena
```

Then continue with Step 3. In the activated environment, replace `uv run -m`
with `python -m` in the commands below; there is no need to run `uv sync`.
The environment uses Python 3.12 and the dependency requirements from
`pyproject.toml`, installing `pywin32` only on Windows. Keep both dependency
lists aligned when adding or changing packages.

This installs the Python dependencies, not Besiege or its mod. Simulation
remains tested only on Windows. Construction currently also imports the GUI
automation modules, so a working desktop display is needed even when the
game is not running.

### Step 3: Configure API Keys and Paths

The included `config.py` loads the root `.env` file automatically. Keep secrets
in `.env`, which is ignored by Git. For Aliyun's `qwen-plus` baseline:

```dotenv
API_KEY_ALI=your-aliyun-api-key
ALI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
SavedMachines=./datacache/SavedMachines
```

For a workspace-specific endpoint, use the URL and matching key from your
Aliyun console. Existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` entries can be
kept by adding these aliases after them:

```dotenv
API_KEY_ALI=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
ALI_BASE_URL=${OPENAI_BASE_URL}
```

Unconfigured providers stay disabled. Other providers use the `API_KEY_*`
names in `config.py`; shell environment variables take precedence over `.env`.
Select the model with `--model qwen-plus`.

Create the writable output directory before construction:

```bash
mkdir -p datacache/SavedMachines
```

For simulation, set `SavedMachines` to the game's existing `SavedMachines`
directory and calibrate the `POS_*` defaults in `config.py` using
`python -m script.find_coords`.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📚 3D Spatial Computation Library

The [intro.ipynb](intro.ipynb) notebook provides a detailed introduction and demonstration of the library's spatial computation functions.

### 🏗️ Construction Process with Default Tasks

> **Note:** The construction process runs independently without requiring the Besiege game.

**1. Task Configuration**

Task details for different categories and levels can be found in [levels.yaml](levels.yaml).

**2. Start Construction**

Run the [run_construction.py](script/run_construction.py) script to start the construction process:

```bash
uv run -m script.run_construction \
  --model gpt-4o \
  --category transport \
  --level soft \
  --n_sample 64 \
  --n_worker 4
```

**3. Monitor Progress**

You can monitor the process status in the task database:
```
datacache/{category}_{level}_{model}_{timestamp}/task_database.db
```

**4. View Results**

The construction result `BSG` files can be imported into the Besiege game for viewing.

### 🎮 Simulation Process with Default Tasks

> **⚠️ Important:** This repository DOES NOT contain Besiege (a commercial software), which is **required** for simulation. The simulation scripts are only tested and verified on **Windows**.

**1. Purchase and Install Besiege**

Purchase the game [Besiege](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/) through the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) platform.

**2. Install Lua Scripting Mod**

Subscribe to the [Lua Scripting Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2383785201&searchtext=Lua) through Steam Besiege Workshop. Steam will automatically download and install the mod. Restart the game if it's already open.

**3. Configure SavedMachines Path**

Right-click the game in Steam and select "Manage → Browse local files". Locate the `SavedMachines` folder and add its path to your `config.py`, so the constructed machines can be accessed in the game.

**4. Activate Lua Scripting Mod**

Start the game and ensure the Lua Scripting Mod is activated:

<p align="left">
  <img src="asset/mod.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="asset/luaon.png" width="45%" />
</p>

**5. Prepare Sandbox Environment**

Enter the last sandbox on the right. Press `Ctrl+L` to show the Lua Scripting Mod panel, then move it slightly to ensure it doesn't block the start button:

<p align="left">
  <img src="asset/sandbox.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="asset/lua.png" width="45%" />
</p>

**6. Calibrate UI Positions (Optional)**

If needed, update the position constants in `config.py`. We provide a tool to find fractional coordinates:

```bash
uv run -m script.find_coords
```

- Press `p` to print coordinates
- Press `q` to quit
- Coordinates will be displayed in the terminal

**7. Set Starting Configuration**

Press `Ctrl+L` again to hide the Lua Scripting Mod panel. This is the proper starting state for simulation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="asset/start.png" width="60%" />
</p>

**8. Setup Custom Levels (For Support Category Only)**

If running Support category simulations, copy the three Besiege level `BLV` files from [asset/](asset/) into the `CustomLevels` directory of the game. Then open the corresponding level in the Level Editor.

**9. Run Simulation**

Execute the [run_simulation.py](script/run_simulation.py) script with your construction database:

```bash
uv run -m script.run_simulation --db path/to/simulation_database.db
```

---

### 📊 Analysis

**Construction Analysis**

Analyze construction costs for each sample using the [sampling_path_analysis.py](analyze/sampling_path_analysis.py) script:

```bash
uv run -m analyze.sampling_path_analysis db_path path/to/task_database.db
```

**Simulation Analysis**

Analyze simulation trajectories to determine success criteria and compute performance indicators:

```bash
uv run -m analyze.sim_common --csv_path path/to/simulation/trajectory.csv
```

Trajectory analysis scripts in [analyze/](analyze/) will evaluate whether machines pass success criteria and compute performance metrics.

### 🛠️ Customization

#### 🤖 Custom LLM Models

We provide several model clients using Autogen in [agents/\_\_init\_\_.py](agents/__init__.py). You can add more models following the same pattern.

#### 📋 Custom Tasks

Add new tasks by editing [levels.yaml](levels.yaml). Each task must have `category` and `level` attributes for the construction process to work properly.

#### 🎯 Custom Simulation

**1. Preprocessing Scripts**

Simulation preprocessing scripts for default tasks and the automation script [operations.py](simulation/operations.py) are provided in [simulation/](simulation/).

**2. Create Custom Scripts**

You can create your own preprocessing script following these examples. Modify the router function `run_simulation` in [scheduler/runner.py](scheduler/runner.py) to use your custom script.

**3. Custom Game Levels**

If specialized game levels are needed, create Besiege Level `BLV` files using the Level Editor in the game.

#### 📈 Custom Analysis

Create custom simulation data analysis scripts following examples in [analyze/](analyze/). Modify the router function `route_simulation_analysis` in [analyze/sim_common.py](analyze/sim_common.py) accordingly.
